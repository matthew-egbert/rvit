# rvit

RVIT stands for Realtime Visualization and Interaction Toolkit. It is an
extension of kivy (http://kivy.org), designed for augmenting scientific models,
simulations and other computational artifacts such as teaching tools.

RVIT’s primary design goals are to…

- Minimise the amount of additional programming required to include realtime
  visualization and interaction (RVI) elements

- Minimise constraints put upon the model (i.e. allow the model to be developed
  with minimal considerations as to how it will be visualized)

- Facilitate rapid prototyping and modification of RVI elements.

- Facilitate a greater degree of interactivity with scientific computational
  artifacts.

If you use RVIT in a work that is published, please cite it.
